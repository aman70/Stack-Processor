# Stack-Processor
A stack based processor implemented in Vivado Design Suite..FPGA implementation
-Built a Stack Processor in IP in Vivado Design Suite
-Designed a bus-memory-stack interface that accommodated synchronous BRAM access from IP and memory
-Maintained a dual pointer reference, one for program location reference and the other for stack reference
-Execution and Implementation of both iterative and recursive subroutine calls. 
-Bus interface written in C for low latency communication with BRAM
